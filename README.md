This is my practise code for the HackerEarth_Identify_the_Animal Deep Learning Challenge
![My result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiyero/HackerEarth_Identify_the_Animal/master/p2.JPG)

This deep learning challenge was carried out in last year summer and is actually my first Deep learning challenge beyond lesson.
I used Pytorch to build the CNN model for the classification task. I was new to CNN therefore didn't demonstrate much
tunning technique nor fine tune the model archiecture.
 
This repo is for document purpose for my porfolio
